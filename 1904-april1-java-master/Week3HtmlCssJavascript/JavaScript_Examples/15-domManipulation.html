        <h1>DOM Manipulation</h1>
        <p>
            DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a representation
            of all of the elements on a webpage. You can think of it as
            a family tree that contains all of the document's html elements
            and details regarding each element's lineage
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are various JavaScript functions that you can use in order
            to affect the DOM. This is called "DOM Manipulation"
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are different ways to get elments:<br>
            -id (using getElementById function in JS)<br>
            -name (using getElmentsByName function)<br>
            -class (using the getElementByCalss function)<br>
            -etc (a lot of others)
        </p>

        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p id = "i1">This has an id of i1!</p>
        <script>
            //We can use getElementByID to get the element above by it's id
            let i1 = document.getElementById('i1'); // selects i1
            //document is the js object that represents the html document
            console.log(i1);
        </script>
        <p name="n1">This paragraph has a name of n1!</p>
        <script>
            //We can use getElementByName to select elements that have the specified name
            //note that this function returns a node list of elements
            let n1 = document.getElementsByName('n1');//selects all elem with the name 'n1'
            console.log(n1);
            console.log(n1[0]);
        </script>
        <p class="c1">This has a class of c1!</p>
        <script>
            //We can use getElementsByClass to get the element above by it's class
            //note that this returns a collection of elements that are of this class
            //can be used to select more than one element
            let c1 = document.getElementsByClassName('c1'); //selects all tags with class 'c1'
            console.log(c1);
            console.log(c1[0]);
        </script>
        <script>
            //now for the actual manipulation portion
            i1.innerHTML = ".innerHTML was used to change the text within this element!";
            i1.style.color = 'blue';
            i1.style.backgroundColor ='yellow';

            c1[0].style.color= 'red'; //note that to change based on class, you must
            //get the item from the collection furst
            n1[0].style.color = 'aquamarine'; //same for name
        </script>
        <div id ="parentDiv">This is the parent div!</div>
        <script>
            //note that you can also use javascript to create new elements!
            var div1 = document.createElement("div");//creates a new div element
            div1.innerHTML = "I am <strong>a child</strong> div (div1)";//adds inner html to child div
            document.getElementById("parentDiv").append(div1);//add div1 as child to parentDiv
            div1.setAttribute("id","child"); //give element withan id="child"
            div1.setAttribute("style","color:orangered");
            div1.parentNode.removeChild(div1);//removes div1 by accessing its parent
        </script>
        <h3>Events!</h3>
        <p>
            We can also use js functions to occur based off of events on our front end!
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are several events you can respond to in JavaScript. A few of these include:
            <br>
            <br>onclick
            <br>onload
            <br>onmouseover
            <br>onkeydown
            <br>onkeyup
            <br>many many more...
        </p>
        <button id="funcButton" onclick="someFunc()">This is a Button</button>
        <script>
            function someFunc(){
                let button = document.getElementById("funcButton");
                button.setAttribute("style","background-color:red; color:lavender");
            }
        </script>
        <p>
            Alternatively, you can also use an event listener in JavaScript
            to trigger a function during some sort of event.
        </p>
        <h3>Event Listener button:</h3>
        <button id="eListen">Random Text... click me please</button>
        <script>
            let ebutton = document.getElementById("eListen");
            ebutton.addEventListener("click",function(){
                //note that 'click' in js corresponds to the 'onclick' attribute
                ebutton.setAttribute("style", "background:aquamarine; color:violet")
            });
            //note that addEventListener takes two params
            //the first is the type of event that will trigger the js fucntion
            //the second is a callback function that actually performs
            //whatever changes desired
        </script>
        <br>
        <br>
